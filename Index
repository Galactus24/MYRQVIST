                    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                    <p>The joumey of Myrqvist started in 2016. It started small, like most things do, but with a very precise idea;
                        to craft quality footwear in a timeless design and at a reasonable price. A product that could withstand
                        both the tost of time as well as the test of trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>How does the equation of top-quality craftsmanship and a madest price point add up? At Myrgvist we
                        pride ourselves n our dedlication to craftsmanship and while all of the design work takes place at our HQ
                        in Stockholm, the shoes get put together by experienced artisans in Portugal, whom we have long standing
                        relations with. We then choose not to add hefty margins, but instead do our best to keep all of our shoes
                        at a price level we deem representative of the craftsmanship that has been put into the production
                        Alltogher this equals what we like to call premium footwear without the premium price tag
                    </p>
                    <p>The Scandinavian design, the attention to the finest of details and the very best of materials from top tan-
                        neres in the worid are at the core of our business. Much thanks to this, we were awarded as the fastest
                        growing footwear brand of Sweden in 2020. Even though we still take pride in our Scandinavian heritage,
                        our-shoesare today wom on every continent across the globe and far from only Swedes know of the brand.
                    </p>
                    <p>The lift off from Swedenis not allthathas changed. Ourfirst shoe was an Oxford, Appelviken, and while we
                        stillkeep plenty of formal options in our arsenal, the assortment has since grown to consist of everything
                        from sneakersand boots,to sandals and accessorles. All share a common denominator of having timeless
                        design, andall come from our consclous cholce of producing shoes that can be wom for years and years
                        to come, Together they make up Myrgvist - premium footwear without the premium price tag
